# spring-hibernate-project

This project it's helping me getting more comfortable with Spring. Here, I will do my best to implement as many features of the Spring Framework as possible, giving me hands-on experience with it.

It is extremely likely for this project to evolve into an app at some point, either a messaging or a web one.

Happy coding :)
